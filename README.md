Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. My passion is understanding the intersection of data science and business analytics.

# Project 1 : Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* bBuilt a client facing API using flask
